## Overview

Sentinel AI is an integrated system for wildfire prediction and management, designed to enhance response in vulnerable ecosystems. It combines machine learning with mobile and web platforms to improve early detection, prevention, and coordination of wildfire events.

## Key Features

- **Predictive Model**: Random Forest model trained on historical and geospatial data, updated monthly.  
- **Mobile App**: Allows citizens to report fires in real time, fostering community participation.  
- **Web Platform**: Risk zone visualization, alert management, and decision-making tools for administrators.  
- **Statistics and Reports**: Automatic generation of reports for trend analysis and resource allocation.  

## Technologies Used

- **React.js & React Native**: Front-end web and mobile development.  
- **Firebase**: Real-time data, authentication, and alert storage.  
- **Python & Scikit-learn**: Predictive modeling with Random Forest.  
- **Google Maps API**: Geospatial visualization and optimized routing.  

## Challenges and Learnings

The main challenge was building a predictive system that balances accuracy and usability. Integrating machine learning with real-time user reports required robust synchronization and continuous validation of the model.

## Outcome

Sentinel AI demonstrated improved wildfire management efficiency, faster response times, and increased community engagement. The system is scalable, adaptable to other regions, and contributes to environmental sustainability.
